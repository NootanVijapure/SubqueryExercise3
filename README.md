Exercise 3: Correlated Subqueries

Objective: Understand and practice using correlated subqueries.

Scenario:You have a table named **products** containing information about various products and their prices. Another table named **orders** contains information about orders placed by customers, including the product\_id and quantity ordered.

1.  **products** table:
    
    *   Columns: product\_id (integer), product\_name (text), price (numeric)
        
2.  **orders** table:
    
    *   Columns: order\_id (integer), product\_id (integer), quantity (integer)
        

Tasks:

1.  Write a correlated subquery to find the product with the highest price.
    
2.  Write a correlated subquery to find the total revenue generated by each product.
    
3.  Write a correlated subquery to find the products with a price greater than the average price of all products.
    

Sample Data:

**products** table:

| product\_id | product\_name | price |

|------------|--------------|-------|

| 1 | Laptop | 1200 |

| 2 | Smartphone | 800 |

| 3 | Tablet | 600 |

| 4 | Camera | 500 |

**orders** table:| order\_id | product\_id | quantity |

|----------|------------|----------|

| 1 | 1 | 2 |

| 2 | 2 | 1 |

| 3 | 3 | 3 |

| 4 | 1 | 1 |
